"""Family memories: "he paid something to an insurance company every March".

Gemini listens to the recording (or reads what the family typed) and turns it into clues: what kind of account,
which institution, any months or amounts mentioned. Code then does the checking, deterministically:
  - each clue is matched against transactions already read from the documents (institution named in the narration,
    or for an unnamed institution, words typical of that kind of payment), narrowed by any month or amount mentioned;
  - the clue is merged through the same upsert() dedup path as documents and inference, always as PROBABLE;
  - confidence comes from the evidence, never from the model: a memory alone is low, a memory backed by one
    matching payment is medium, by two or more is high.

Write out what they said (transcript), then list one clue per account, policy, investment or loan they mention.

- what_they_said: a short quote or close paraphrase, in the language they spoke.
- months / amount_hint: only what they actually said.
- Do not add anything they did not mention. Do not guess institutions or numbers.
- Never write down a PIN, OTP, password or card number, even if they say one: write [removed] instead.
